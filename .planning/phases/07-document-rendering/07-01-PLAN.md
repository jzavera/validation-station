# Plan 07-01: Document Rendering

## Objective
Build PDF and image document viewers for the left panel, with automatic dispatch based on document type and zoom support.

## Requirements Addressed
- DOC-01: Multi-page PDF rendering via react-pdf
- DOC-02: Image rendering (PNG/JPG) with same overlay support structure
- DOC-03: Auto-dispatch to correct renderer based on document.type
- DOC-04: Zoom via header buttons and +/- keys (already wired in Phase 2/5)
- DOC-05: Zoom persists across field navigation (already in reducer state)

## Components

### 1. PdfViewer.tsx
- Uses `Document` and `Page` from `react-pdf`
- Imports annotation and text layer CSS
- Renders all pages in scrollable container
- Each page wrapped in position:relative div (overlay support)
- Uses `zoom` prop for page scale
- Forwards ref to scroll container

### 2. ImageViewer.tsx
- Single `<img>` in scrollable container
- Image wrapped in position:relative div (overlay support)
- CSS transform zoom with transform-origin: top left
- Error fallback for missing images
- Forwards ref to scroll container

### 3. DocumentViewer.tsx
- Reads document.type from context
- Dispatches to PdfViewer or ImageViewer
- Passes zoom from state

### 4. App.tsx Update
- Replace left panel placeholder with `<DocumentViewer />`

## Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- `npm run build` succeeds
- Image viewer renders with sample data (type: "image")
- PDF viewer path exists for pdf type documents
