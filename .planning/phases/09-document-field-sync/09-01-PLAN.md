# Plan 09-01: Document-Field Synchronization

## Goal
When a field becomes active, the document viewer automatically scrolls to center the field's bounding box region in the viewport with smooth animation.

## Tasks

1. **Create `src/hooks/useDocumentScroll.ts`**
   - Takes: `scrollContainerRef`, `activeField: Field | null`, `zoom: number`
   - On activeField change, find the page element via `data-page-number` selector
   - Calculate target Y offset within the page using normalized bbox coordinates
   - Scroll the container to center that position with smooth behavior

2. **Wire the hook in `src/components/DocumentViewer.tsx`**
   - Derive activeField (already done in Phase 8)
   - Pass scrollRef and activeField to the hook
   - The hook triggers scroll on activeField changes

3. **Lift scroll ref management to DocumentViewer**
   - DocumentViewer manages the scrollRef and passes it to viewers
   - The useDocumentScroll hook operates on this ref

## Requirements Covered
- SYNC-01: Active field triggers scroll to bounding box region
- SYNC-02: Works across multi-page PDF documents
- SYNC-03: Smooth scroll animation

## Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- `npm run build` succeeds
- Clicking or Tab-navigating to a field scrolls the document to show that region
- Scroll animation is smooth, not instant
